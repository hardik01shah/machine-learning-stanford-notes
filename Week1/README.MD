# Week 1:

## Supervised Learning:
The algorithm is given a set of right answers or a dataset for giving the output. In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.

Supervised learning problems are categorized into "regression" and "classification" problems. In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. In a classification problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories.

### Regression: </br>
Predict continuous valued output.

### Classification: </br>
Predict discrete valued output. e.g. 0 or 1
There can be more possible values of output but they will be finite and discrete.

## Unsupervised Learning:
Find structure in the given data
e.g CLustering algorithms

svd single value decomposition
